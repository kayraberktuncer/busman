<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Busman is a passenger transportation company management game.
Busman allows us to start and manage a fictitious passenger transportation company. In this way, it allows us to relieve the stress of daily life and make our lives a little more fun by diving into different dreams.
It offers an enjoyable experience to play thanks to its non-tiring structure and forcing to dream.
